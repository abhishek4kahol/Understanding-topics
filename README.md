## Understanding JavaScript and EcmaScript

* Ecma International : An organization that creates standards for technologies.

### ECMA-262
1. This is a standard published by Ecma International.It contains the specification for a general purpose scripting language.
2. ECMA-262 is a standard that represents a scripting language specification called **ECMAScript**.
3. It is a specification for creating a general purpose scripting language.
4. ECMAScript provides the rules, details, and guidelines that a scripting language must observe to be considered ECMAScript compliant.

### JavaScript
1. A general purpose scripting language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. It is a dialect of the ECMAScript language.
2. JavaScript is the coffee-flavored language and ECMAScript is the specification it’s based on.
3. By reading the [ECMAScript specification](https://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/Ecma-262.pdf), you learn how to create a scripting language. By reading the [JavaScript documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript), you learn how to use a scripting language.

4. JavaScript mostly implements the ECMAScript specification as described in ECMA-262, but a handful of differences do exist. Mozilla outlines JavaScript’s non-ECMAScript language features [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/New_in_JavaScript/ECMAScript_Next_support_in_Mozilla).

### Differences in browser support

* Even though the JavaScript engines of browsers all understand JavaScript, some browsers have a greater understanding of the language than others. There are differences in the way browsers support the language.

* If you will recall, ECMAScript is a specification for what a scripting language could look like. Releasing a new edition of ECMAScript does not mean that all JavaScript engines in existence suddenly have those new features. It is up to the groups or organizations who are responsible for JavaScript engines to be up-to-date about the latest ECMAScript specification, and to adopt its changes.

* If a new edition of ECMAScript comes out, JavaScript engines do not integrate the entire update at one go. They incorporate the new ECMAScript features incrementally

### ECMAScript 6

* It is the sixth edition of the ECMA-262 standard, and features major changes and improvements to the ECMAScript specification.
* This edition of ECMAScript changed its name from ES6 to ES2015 because in 2015 Ecma International decided to switch to annual releases of ECMAScript.
